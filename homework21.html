<h1>Yeonjeong kim</h1>
<p><br>I am Kim Yeon-jung, a senior majoring in digital media design at Dongseo University. I am mainly studying the ux/ui field and my goal is to become a web designer who can handle the front-end area. Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, xd, html, css, etc. There are still few things I can handle, but I am studying hard.

<br><br>I graduated from a foreign language high school and my specialty is Japanese, so I can speak in general. I have previously obtained the JLPT N1 certificate and am planning to renew it again. I hope this helps me study my major.

<br><br>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.

<br><br>These are the design tools I can handle.
